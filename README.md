# BACK~~GROUND~~ SPACE

## What is it

BackSpace uses **NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day API** to fetch the image for the current day.

Then you're able to **save it** for later in an archive and eventually make your personal space background collection.

## Why
I made this project basically to experiment and test Firebase for JS SDK.

The project in fact, uses:
 * **Firebase Auth** to authenticate the user;
 * **Firebase Realtime Db** to save the favourite images;
 * **Materialize** for UI;
